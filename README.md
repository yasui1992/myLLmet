# myLLmet

A personal LLM evaluation project â€” the name stands for **my LLM metrics**.  
Inspired by tools like [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas), but reimplemented from scratch to better understand how LLM evaluation works.  
The LLM used in this project is provided by AWS Bedrock.
